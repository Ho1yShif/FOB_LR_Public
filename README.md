Independent Study Project: Classification of Fall Out Boy eras

## Abstract

Logistic regression (LR) models have become the standard for binary classification. Modern supervised machine learning often leverages LR, a statistical modeling technique, to predict whether a given event will fall into one of two categories: Class 0 or Class 1.

Generally, this process helps data scientists learn which variables are good predictors of class membership, which loans to invest in, and how to generate millions of dollars for their companies. When applied to medicine, logistic regression can predict who is more susceptible to disease; in this way, machine learning saves lives. 

For this project, I use data from Spotify and Genius to build a database consisting of songs and lyrics written by my favorite band, Fall Out Boy. I then construct a logistic regression model to classify the songs and lyrics into one of these two Fall Out Boy eras: pre-hiatus or post-hiatus. Most Fall Out Boy listeners can instantly tell which era the song belongs to; this study will determine if a computer can also differentiate between the two. Additionally, I will test the regression against a few other algorithms, including random forest and support vector machines.
