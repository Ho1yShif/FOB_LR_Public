## Abstract

The statistical modeling technique of logistic regression (LR) has become the standard for binary classification. Supervised machine learning often leverages LR to predict whether a given event will fall into one of two categories: Class 0 or Class 1.

Generally, this process helps data scientists learn which variables are good predictors of class membership. One business application might be the million-dollar industry of loan classification. When applied to medicine, logistic regression can predict who is more susceptible to disease; in this way, machine learning saves lives. 

For this project, I used data from Spotify and Genius to build a dataset consisting of songs and lyrics written by my favorite band, Fall Out Boy. I then constructed a logistic regression model to classify the songs and lyrics into one of two Fall Out Boy eras: pre-hiatus or post-hiatus.

Most Fall Out Boy listeners can instantly tell which era a song belongs toâ€“ This study determined whether a computer could also differentiate between the two. Additionally, I tested the regression against other binary classification algorithms, including Random Forest and Support Vector Machines.
